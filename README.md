### Hi, I'm Shafin ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about all things software, and spend most of my time [building tools on my own]({{<ref "/projects/index.md" >}}). 

So far I've built programming language interpreters, web applications, chrome extensions, android apps and many more. I have also worked heavily with distributed systems.

Previously, I worked at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as a Software Engineer Intern on the [Azure API Management Team](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/api-management/).

I currently attend the [University of Toronto](https://fas.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science).

Follow my work on [Github](https://github.com/shafinsiddique) or on my personal [blog]({{<ref "/posts/" >}}).
